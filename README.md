the idea is to creat a responsive website with an index landing page, student section , school section and tutor login to enter their dashboard

the student section will have the courses the student can do ad to enter that course the student has to enter a class code the tutor had generated, inside each course card is questions about the course with scores updated for each right answer

the tutors section is where the tutor will see the school he or she is assigned to and the time and the days lesson with start cllass to give the students class code to do the question and when not doing the questions it can be used as a mark one has attendend the class

the admin assigns the school tutor , schedules classes and deletes classes and all necessary fuction to make the system work.
